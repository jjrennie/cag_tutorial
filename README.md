# Plotting Data from NCEI's Climate at a Glance Tool
## Written By Jared Rennie

This tutorial uses python to download and plot data from <a href='https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national' target="_blank">NCEI's Climate at a Glance</a> Tool. Specifically, it plots a map for each US state (and also provides a SHP/KML file of the results).

### What You Need

First off, the entire codebase works in Python... sort of. 

You will need the following programs installed: 
- Python
- numpy | pandas | geopandas | shapely | matplotlib | cartopy | simplekml 
    
The "easiest" way is to install these is by installing <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/' target="_blank">Anaconda</a>, and then applying <a href='https://conda-forge.org/' target="_blank">conda-forge</a>. Afterward, then you can install the above packages.
