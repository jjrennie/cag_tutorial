## Written By Jared Rennie

This tutorial uses python to download and plot data from <a href='https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national' target="_blank">NCEI's Climate at a Glance</a> Tool. Specifically, it plots a map for each US state (and also provides a SHP/KML file of the results).

You will need the following programs installed: 
- Python
- numpy | pandas | geopandas | shapely | matplotlib | cartopy | simplekml
